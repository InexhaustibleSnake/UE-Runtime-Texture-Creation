This plugin allows you to create textures runtime from images

The plugin is made from the Engine Subsystem. At the beginning of initialization, the subsystem checks if the Runtime Textures folder exists. If not, it creates this folder.

By default the folder is called "Runtime Textures". You can change its name by changing the RuntimeTexturesFolderName variable in the ISRuntimeTextureSubsystem class
